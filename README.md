# SB is Homebrew for the server

Don't you wish there was a standard way to build your Python or NodeJS application? Don't you wish you could pick from a catalog of standard configurations for your backend components, without worrying about locking yourself into a proprietary cloud platform?

PaaS-style platforms such as dotCloud and Heroku make deployment super simple, but they each use their own build tools and scripts, making your application harder to migrate.

Legacy configuration tools such as Chef and Puppet are more open, but they are focused on managing servers instead of deploying applications.


Stackbrew is the best of both worlds: it uses the application-centered model pioneered by dotCloud and Heroku. And it's completely open - you can use it to deploy your application *anywhere*.



## Status

SB is alpha software - it is stil experimental and should be used with care. Contributions are welcome!
